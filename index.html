<p>Noisli started as a side project in September 2013. At that time me and Sabine were working as freelance designers from home. It was hard to motivate ourselves and to not feel isolated since the environment around us was too silent and not inspiring. On the other hand, working in an office or co-working space is often too loud and has too many distractions. Thatâ€™s why we decided to create our own solution to the problem, Noisli.</p>

<a id="simplicity-and-care-for-people" class="anchor" href="#simplicity-and-care-for-people" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SIMPLICITY AND CARE FOR PEOPLE</h2>

<p>At Noisli we love simplicity and details and we spent every day passioned about what we are doing. We are driven by our goal to create the best product possible and by the support of our users.We put people at the core of our work, and we want to build and grow Noisli around people and their needs. We want to solve a real problem and try to make the world a better place. </p>
